# cli_menu

![Screencast of cli_menu in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filiph/cli_menu/master/example/mac_screencast.gif)

A library for adding simple menus to console (CLI) apps.
It displays a list of options and then allows the user to make a selection
using the up and down arrows on the keyboard (when ANSI is available),
or by typing a number as a prompt.

This library is conservative - it favors compatibility
over fancy ANSI features and Unicode glyphs.
